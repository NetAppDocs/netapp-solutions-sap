The NetApp AFF product family is certified for use with SAP HANA in TDI projects. The certified enterprise storage platform is characterized by the NetApp ONTAP software.

Marco Schoen, NetApp

== Introduction

The NetApp AFF A-Series and AFF C-Series product families have been certified for use with SAP HANA in tailored data center integration (TDI) projects.

This certification is valid for the following models:

* AFF A150, AFF A20, AFF A250, AFF A30, AFF A400, AFF A50, AFF A70, AFF A800, AFF A90, AFF A900, AFF A1K
* AFF C250, AFF C30, AFF C400, AFF C60, AFF C800, AFF C80
* ASA A250, ASA A400, ASA A800, ASA A900
* ASA C250, ASA C400, ASA C800
[NOTE]
NetApp AFF and ASA C-Series requires NetApp ONTAP 9.13.1 or later

For a complete list of NetApp certified storage solutions for SAP HANA, see the https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/#/solutions?filters=v:deCertified;ve:13[Certified and supported SAP HANA hardware directory^].

This document describes AFF configurations that use the Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP).

[NOTE]
The configuration described in this paper is necessary to achieve the required SAP HANA KPIs and the best performance for SAP HANA. Changing any settings or using features not listed herein might cause performance degradation or unexpected behavior and should only be done if advised by NetApp support.

The configuration guides for AFF systems using NFS and NetApp FAS systems can be found using the following links:

In an SAP HANA multiple-host environment, the standard SAP HANA storage connector is used to provide fencing in the event of an SAP HANA host failover. Always refer to the relevant SAP notes for operating system configuration guidelines and HANA specific Linux kernel dependencies.

== SAP HANA tailored data center integration

NetApp AFF storage systems are certified in the SAP HANA TDI program using both NFS (NAS) and FC (SAN) protocols. They can be deployed in any of the current SAP HANA scenarios, such as SAP Business Suite on HANA, S/4HANA, BW/4HANA, or SAP Business Warehouse on HANA in either single-host or multiple-host configurations. Any server that is certified for use with SAP HANA can be combined with NetApp certified storage solutions. The following figure shows an architecture overview.

= SAP HANA using VMware vSphere

There are several options to connect storage to virtual machines (VMs). The preferred one is to connect the storage volumes with NFS directly out of the guest operating system. This option is described in link:hana-aff-nfs-introduction.html[SAP HANA on NetApp AFF Systems with NFS].

Raw device mappings (RDM), FCP datastores, or VVOL datastores with FCP are supported as well. For both datastore options, only one SAP HANA data or log volume must be stored within the datastore for productive use cases.
