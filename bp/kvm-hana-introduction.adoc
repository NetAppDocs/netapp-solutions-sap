Deploy SAP HANA Single-Host on SUSE KVM using NetApp storage with SR-IOV network interfaces and NFS or FCP storage access. Follow this workflow to configure virtual interfaces, assign them to VMs, and set up storage connections for optimal performance.

For an overview of SAP HANA on KVM virtualization, refer to the SUSE documentation: https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/sap-15/pdf/SBP-SLES4SAP-HANAonKVM-SLES15SP5_en.pdf[SUSE Best Practices for SAP HANA on KVM].
