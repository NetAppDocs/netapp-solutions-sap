This section provides information about how to configure FCP in SUSE KVM for SAP HANA using NetApp storage.


== Assigning FCP ports to the VM
As there is no similar feature like SR-IOV for FCP, the physical HBA ports need to be assigned to the VM. Two physical ports attached to different fabrics need to be used.

[NOTE] 
A physical port must be assigned to one VM only.

To do so complete the following steps:

[arabic]
. Start _virt-manager._ +

. Open the desired VM. +

. Press “Add Hardware". +

. Choose the desired HBA port from the list of PCI Host Device and press finish. +
In this example 0000.A2:00:0. +

. Choose the desired HBA port from the list of PCI Host Device belonging to the second fabric and press finish. In this example 0000.A2:00:1. +

. Afterwards the physical HBA ports are assigned to the VM and the VM can be started. +

As physical ports have been passed through to the VM, no additional preparation needs to be done.
