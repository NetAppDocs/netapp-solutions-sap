During the refresh workflow,  the storage clone must be deleted. You can use the same Ansible playbook as for the system destroy workflow. However,  the custom hook is defined to a different step, so the playbook is named accordingly.  The process step for the clone doesnÂ´t differ.

The refresh workflow can be triggered through the provisioning screen for a copied system.

Again nothing differs in the input screens from the standard and the workflow execution can be started from the summary screen.
