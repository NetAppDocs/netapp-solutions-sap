== Tenant name(s) at target system

The steps required to perform an SAP HANA system refresh depend on the source system tenant configuration and the required tenant name at the target system, as shown in the figure below.

Since the tenant name is configured in the system database, the tenant name of the source system is also available at the target system after the recovery of the system database. Therefore, the tenant at the target system can only be recovered with the same name as the source tenant as shown in option 1. If the tenant name at the target system must be different, the tenant must first be recovered with the same name as the source tenant and then renamed to the required target tenant name. This is option 2.

An exception of this rule is an SAP HANA system with a single tenant, where the tenant name is identical to the system SID. This configuration is the default after an initial SAP HANA installation. This specific configuration is flagged by the SAP HANA database. In this case, tenant recovery at the target system can be executed with the tenant name of the target system, which must be also identical to the system SID of the target system. This workflow is shown in option 3.

[NOTE]
As soon as any tenant create, rename, or drop operation is executed at the source system, this configuration flag is deleted by the SAP HANA database. Therefore, even if the configuration has been brought back to tenant = SID, the flag is no longer available and the exception regarding tenant recovery with workflow 3 is no longer possible. In this case, option 2 is the required workflow.

== System refresh workflow with enabled SAP HANA encryption

When SAP HANA persistence encryption is enabled, additional steps are required before you can recover the SAP HANA database at the target system.

At the source system you need to create a backup of the encryption root keys for the system database, as well as for all tenant databases. The backup files must be copied to the target system and the root keys must be imported from the backup before the recovery operation is executed.

=== Backup of root keys

A backup of the root keys is always required, if any changes to the root keys have been made.
The backup command requires the dbid as a CLI parameter. The dbid’s can be identified using the below SQL statement.

image:sc-copy-clone-image12.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

The SQL statement and further documentation is available in the SAP HANA Admin Guide at https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/6b94445c94ae495c83a19646e7c3fd56/b1e7562e2c704c19bd86f2f9f4feedc4.html[Back Up Root Keys | SAP Help Portal]
The following steps are illustrating the required operations for a HANA system with a single tenant SS1 and are executed at the source system.

. Set backup password for system and tenant (SS1) databases (if not done yet).

....
hdbsql SYSTEMDB=> ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION ROOT KEYS BACKUP PASSWORD Netapp123;
0 rows affected (overall time 3658.128 msec; server time 3657.967 msec)
hdbsql SYSTEMDB=>
hdbsql SS1=> ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION ROOT KEYS BACKUP PASSWORD Netapp123;
0 rows affected (overall time 2424.236 msec; server time 2424.010 msec)
hdbsql SS1=>
....

[start=2]
. Create backup of root keys for system and tenant (SS1) databases.

....
ss1adm@hana-1:/usr/sap/SS1/home> /usr/sap/SS1/HDB00/exe/hdbnsutil -backupRootKeys root-key-backup-SS1-SYSTEMDB.rkb --dbid=1 --type='ALL'

done.
ss1adm@hana-1:/usr/sap/SS1/home> /usr/sap/SS1/HDB00/exe/hdbnsutil -backupRootKeys root-key-backup-SS1-SS1.rkb --dbid=3 --type='ALL'
Exporting root key backup for database SS1 (DBID: 3) to /usr/sap/SS1/home/root-key-backup-SS1-SS1.rkb

....

[start=3]
. Validate root key backups (optional)

....

done.
....

=== Import of root keys at the target system

The import of the root keys is required initially for the first system refresh operation. If the root keys are not changed at the source system, no additional import is required.
The import command requires the dbid as a CLI parameter. The dbid’s can be identified in the same way as described for the root key backup.

. In our setup the root keys are copied from the source system to an NFS share

....
hana-1:~ # cp /usr/sap/SS1/home/root-key-backup-SS1-SS1.rkb /mnt/sapcc-share/SAP-System-Refresh/
hana-1:~ # cp /usr/sap/SS1/home/root-key-backup-SS1-SYSTEMDB.rkb /mnt/sapcc-share/SAP-System-Refresh/
....

[start=2]
. The root keys can now be imported using hdbnsutil. The dbid for the system and tenant database must be provided with the command. The backup password is also required.

....
qs1adm@hana-7:/usr/sap/QS1/HDB11> ./exe/hdbnsutil -recoverRootKeys /mnt/sapcc-share/SAP-System-Refresh/root-key-backup-SS1-SYSTEMDB.rkb --dbid=1 --type=ALL
Please Enter the password:

done.
qs1adm@hana-7:/usr/sap/QS1/HDB11>
....

=== Root key import, if dbid does not exist at target

As described in the chapter before, the dbid is required to import the root key for the system and all tenant databases. While the system database has always dbid=0, the tenant databases can have different dbid’s.

image:sc-copy-clone-image13.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

The output above shows two tenants with dbid=3 and dbid=4. If the target system has not yet hosted a tenant with dbid=4, the import of the root key will fail. In that case you need to recover the system database first and then import the key for the tenant with dbid=4.
