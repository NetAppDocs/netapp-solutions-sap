In this document, two scripts are used to further automate SnapCenter clone create and clone delete operations.

* The script `sc-system-refresh`.sh is used for the system refresh and the system clone workflow to execute recovery and shutdown operations of the HANA database.
* The script `sc-mount-volume.sh` is used for the system clone workflow to execute mount and unmount operations for the HANA shared volume.
[NOTE]
The example scripts are provided as is and are not supported by NetApp. You can request the scripts via email to ng-sapcc@netapp.com.

== Script sc-system-refresh.sh

The example script `sc-system-refresh.sh` is used to execute recovery and shutdown operations. The script is called with specific command-line options within the SnapCenter workflows clone create and clone delete, as shown in the figure below.

The script is generic and reads all required parameters, like the SID from the target system. The script must be available at the target host of the system refresh operation. An hdb user store key must be configured for the user <SID>adm at the target system. The key must allow access to the HANA system database and provide privileges for recovery operations. The key must have the name <TARGET-SID>KEY.

The script writes a log file `sc-system-refresh-SID.log``, to the same directory, where it gets executed.


[NOTE]
The current version of the script supports single host systems MDC single tenant, or MDC multiple tenant configurations. It does not support SAP HANA multiple-host systems.

=== Supported tenant recovery operations

As described in the section “SAP HANA system refresh operation workflows using storage snapshot” the possible tenant recovery operations at the target system depend on the tenant configuration of the source system. The script `sc-system-refresh.sh` supports all tenant recovery operations, which are possible dependent on the source system configuration, as shown in the table below.

If a different tenant name is required at the target system, the tenant must be renamed manually after the recovery operation.

|===
|HANA system |Tenant configuration +
at source system |Resulting tenant configuration +
at target system
|MDC single tenant |Source tenant name equal to source SID |Target tenant name is equal to target SID
|MDC single tenant |Source tenant name not equal to source SID |Target tenant name is equal to source tenant name
|MDC multiple tenants |Any tenant names |All tenants are recovered and will have the same name as the source tenants.
|===

== Script sc-mount-volume.sh

The example script `sc-mount-volume.sh` is used to execute mount and unmount for any volume. The script is used to mount the HANA shared volume with the SAP HANA system clone operation. The script is called with specific command-line options within the SnapCenter workflows clone create and clone delete, as shown in the figure below.

[NOTE]
The script supports HANA systems using NFS as a storage protocol.

=== SnapCenter environment variables

SnapCenter provides a set of environment variables that are available within the script that is executed at the target host. The script uses these variables to determine relevant configuration settings.

* The script variables `STORAGE, JUNCTION_PATH` are used for the mount operation.

* Derived from `CLONED_VOLUMES_MOUNT_PATH` environment variable.
* `CLONED_VOLUMES_MOUNT_PATH=${STORAGE}:/${JUNCTION_PATH}`
* For example: `CLONED_VOLUMES_MOUNT_PATH=192.168.175.117:/SS1_shared_Clone_05112206115489411`

== Script to get SnapCenter environment variables

If the automation scripts should not be used and the steps should be executed manually, you need to know the storage system junction path of the FlexClone volume. The junction path is not visible within SnapCenter, so you need to either look up the junction path directly at the storage system, or you could use a simple script that provides the SnapCenter environment variables at the target host. This script needs to be added as a mount operation script within the SnapCenter clone create operation.

....
ss1adm@hana-1:/mnt/sapcc-share/SAP-System-Refresh> cat get-env.sh
#!/bin/bash
env > /tmp/env-from-sc.txt
ss1adm@hana-1:/mnt/sapcc-share/SAP-System-Refresh>
....

Within the `env-from-sc.txt` file, look for the variable `CLONED_VOLUMES_MOUNT_PATH` to get the storage system IP address and junction path of the FlexClone volume.

For example: `CLONED_VOLUMES_MOUNT_PATH=192.168.175.117:/SS1_data_mnt00001_Clone_05112206115489411`
