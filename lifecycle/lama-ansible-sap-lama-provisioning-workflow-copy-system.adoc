The following figure highlights the primary steps executed with the system copy workflow.

In this chapter, we briefly discuss the differences for the system clone workflow and input screens. As you can see in the following image, nothing changes in the storage workflow.

. The system copy workflow can be started when the system is prepared accordingly. This is not a specific task for this configuration, and we do not explain it in detail. If you need further information, review the SAP LaMa documentation.

. During the copy workflow, the system is renamed, as must be specified in the first screen.

. During the workflow, you can change the instance numbers.

+
[NOTE]
Changing instance numbers has not been tested and might require changes in the provider script.

. As described, the *Custom Clone* screen does not differ from the cloning workflow, as is shown here.
+

. As we already described, the remaining input masks do not deviate from the standard, and we do not go into them any further here. The final screen shows a summary, and execution can now be started.

After the copy process, the target instance is not enabled for the custom cloning process.

It must be adopted manually to run the pre-hook step during the system destroy process because a constraint is set and would prevent execution.
