Depending on whether the log backup replication is part of the disaster recovery setup, the steps for disaster recovery are slightly different. This section describes the disaster recovery failover for data-backup-only replication as well as for data volume replication combined with log backup volume replication.

To execute disaster recovery failover, complete these steps:

. Prepare the target host.
. Break and delete the replication relationships.
. Restore the data volume to the latest application- consistent snapshot backup.
. Mount the volumes at the target host.
. Recover the HANA database.

** Data volume recovery only.
** Forward recovery using replicated log backups.

The following subsections describe these steps in detail, and the following figure depicts disaster failover testing.
