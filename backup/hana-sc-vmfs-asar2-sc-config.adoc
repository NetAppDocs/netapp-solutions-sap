== Pre-requisites

=== SnapCenter HANA resource must be auto discovered

Resources configured with VMware VMFS must be auto discovered by SnapCenter to enable specific operations required for these configurations.

Since HANA non-data volumes are always manually configured resources in SnapCenter, they are not supported by SnapCenter with VMFS.

SAP HANA multiple host systems must be configured using a central HANA plugin and are therefore manually configured by default. Such systems are also not supported by SnapCenter when using VMware VMFS.

=== SnapCenter for VMWare vSphere plugin

The SnapCenter for VMware vSphere plugin must be deployed in the VMware environment.

=== Storage SVM management IP

Storage SVMs hosting the LUN’s must have a management interface configured, otherwise the SVMs will not be listed in SnapCenter when adding storage with the “add cluster” option and auto discovery operation will fail.

=== VM disk parameter 

The parameter must be set as described in chapter link:hana-sc-vmfs-asar2-hana-prov.html#vm-parameter-disk-enableuuid[“VM parameter disk.EnableUUID”], otherwise SnapCenter database auto discovery will fail.

=== Configure SnapCenter to use REST APIs for storage communication

SnapCenter must be configured to use REST APIs for storage communications. Otherwise, the create Snapshot operation will fail with the error message shown below.

The parameter "IsRestEnabledForStorageConnection" in the configuration file +
C:++\++Program Files++\++NetApp++\++SMCore++\++SMCoreServiceHost.dll.config must be set to “true”.

++<++add key="IsRestEnabledForStorageConnection" value="true" /++>++

After the change has been made, SnapCenter SMCore Service must be stopped and started.

== Add VMware Plugin to SnapCenter

Before the host can be added in SnapCenter the SnapCenter plugin for VMware vSphere must be deployed within the VMware environment. See also https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/sc-plugin-vmware-vsphere/scpivs44_deploy_snapcenter_plug-in_for_vmware_vsphere.html[Deploy SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere].

[NOTE]
Credentials must be set during host add workflow, where vSphere can be selected as a host type.

== Add HANA host

[NOTE]
 No specific requirements. Plugin deployment and auto discovery is done as usual.

image:sc-hana-asrr2-vmfs-image16.png["Figure demonstrating the content being discussed"]

With the auto discovery process SnapCenter detects that the HANA resource is running virtualized with VMFS.

== Policy and resource protection configuration

Nothing specific to VMware with VMFS.
