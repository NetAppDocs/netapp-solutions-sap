The following subsections describe the recovery process with and without forward recovery using the replicated log backups. The recovery is executed using the HANA recovery script for the system database and hdbsql commands for the tenant database.

== Recovery to latest HANA data volume backup savepoint

The recovery to the latest backup savepoint is executed with the following commands as user pr1adm:

* System database

....
recoverSys.py --command "RECOVER DATA USING SNAPSHOT CLEAR LOG”
....

* Tenant database

....
Within hdbsql: RECOVER DATA FOR PR1 USING SNAPSHOT CLEAR LOG
....

You can also use HANA Studio or Cockpit to execute the recovery of the system and the tenant database.

The following command output show the recovery execution.

....

=== Tenant database recovery

If a user store key has not been created for the pr1adm user at the source system, a key must be created at the target system. The database user configured in the key must have privileges to execute tenant recovery operations.

....
pr1adm@vm-pr1:/usr/sap/PR1/HDB01> hdbuserstore set PR1KEY vm-pr1:30113 <backup-user> <password>
....

The tenant recovery is now executed with hdbsql.

....
pr1adm@vm-pr1:/usr/sap/PR1/HDB01> hdbsql -U PR1KEY
Welcome to the SAP HANA Database interactive terminal.

       \q to quit
hdbsql SYSTEMDB=> RECOVER DATA FOR PR1 USING SNAPSHOT CLEAR LOG
0 rows affected (overall time 66.973089 sec; server time 66.970736 sec)
hdbsql SYSTEMDB=>
....

The HANA database is now up and running, and the disaster recovery workflow for the HANA database has been tested.

== Recovery with forward recovery using log/catalog backups

Log backups and the HANA backup catalog are being replicated from the source system.

The recovery using all available log backups is executed with the following commands as user pr1adm:

* System database

....
recoverSys.py --command "RECOVER DATABASE UNTIL TIMESTAMP '2021-02-20 00:00:00' CLEAR LOG USING SNAPSHOT"
....

* Tenant database

....
Within hdbsql: RECOVER DATABASE FOR PR1 UNTIL TIMESTAMP '2021-02-20 00:00:00' CLEAR LOG USING SNAPSHOT
....

[NOTE]
To recover using all available logs, you can just use any time in the future as the timestamp in the recovery statement.

You can also use HANA Studio or Cockpit to execute the recovery of the system and the tenant database.

The following command output show the recovery execution.

=== System database recovery

pr1adm@vm-pr1:/usr/sap/PR1/HDB01> HDBSettings.sh recoverSys.py --command "RECOVER DATABASE UNTIL TIMESTAMP '2021-02-20 00:00:00' CLEAR LOG USING SNAPSHOT"

The HANA database is now up and running, and the disaster recovery workflow for the HANA database has been tested.

== Check consistency of latest log backups

Because log backup volume replication is performed independently of the log backup process executed by the SAP HANA database, there might be open, inconsistent log backup files at the disaster recovery site. Only the latest log backup files might be inconsistent, and those files should be checked before a forward recovery is performed at the disaster recovery site using the `hdbbackupcheck` tool.

If the `hdbbackupcheck` tool reports an error for the latest log backups, the latest set of log backups must be removed or deleted.

....
pr1adm@hana-10: > hdbbackupcheck /hanabackup/PR1/log/SYSTEMDB/log_backup_0_0_0_0.1589289811148
Loaded library 'libhdbcsaccessor'
Loaded library 'libhdblivecache'
Backup '/mnt/log-backup/SYSTEMDB/log_backup_0_0_0_0.1589289811148' successfully checked.
....

The check must be executed for the latest log backup files of the system and the tenant database.

If the `hdbbackupcheck` tool reports an error for the latest log backups, the latest set of log backups must be removed or deleted.
