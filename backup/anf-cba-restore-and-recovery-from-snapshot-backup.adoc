The following section describes the restore and recovery workflows for a HANA MDC single-host, single-tenant system. The differences for a multiple- host system are highlighted. The examples show SAP HANA Studio as a tool to execute manual recovery. You can also use SAP HANA Cockpit or HANA SQL statements for the recovery operations.

To restore and recover an SAP HANA MDC single-tenant system using SAP HANA Studio and Cloud Backup for Applications, complete the following steps:

. Prepare the restore and recovery process with SAP HANA Studio:
.. Select *Recover System Database* and confirm the shutdown of the SAP HANA system.
.. Select the recovery type and the log backup location.
+
The list of data backups displays.

.. Select the relevant backup to see the external backup ID.
. Unmount the HANA data volumes.
. Perform the restore process with Cloud Backup for Applications:
.. In the Backup view, select the backup that matches the external backup ID or comment field from SAP HANA Studio.
.. To start the restore operation, select *Restore* in the context menu.
. Mount the HANA data volumes.
. Run the recovery process for the system database with SAP HANA Studio:
.. Click *Refresh* from the backup list and select the available backup for recovery (indicated with a green icon).
.. Start the recovery operation.
+
After the recovery operation is finished, the system database is started.

. Run the recovery process for the tenant database with SAP HANA Studio:
.. Select *Recover Tenant Database* and select the tenant to be recovered.
.. Select the recovery type and the log backup location.

. A list of data backups displays. Because the data volume has already been restored, the tenant backup indicates as available (in green). 
.. Select the backup and start the recovery process. After the recovery process is finished, the tenant database is started automatically.

A list of data backups displays. Because the data volume has already been restored, the tenant backup indicates as available (in green). Select the backup and start the recovery process. After the recovery process is finished, the tenant database is started automatically.

The following steps describe the restore and recovery operations of the HANA system PR1.

. Unmount all data volumes.
+
....
umount /hana/data/PR1/mnt00001
....
+
[NOTE]
For an SAP HANA multiple host system, you must unmount all the data volumes on each host.

== Restore HANA database

. To start the restore operation, in the Backup view, select the backup, which is also shows in HANA Studio, and select Restore in the context menu.
+

+
The Cloud Backup for Applications job log shows the progress of the restore operation.
+

. Wait until the restore process completes and mount the data volume.
+
....
mount /hana/data/SP1/mnt00001
....
+
[NOTE]
For an SAP HANA multiple host system, you must mount all the data volumes on each host.

== Recover system database

. To update the list of available backups, go to SAP HANA Studio and click Refresh. The backup that was restored with Cloud Backup for Applications is shown with a green icon in the list of backups. Select the backup and click Next.
+
image:anf-cba-image87.png["Screenshot of the step being completed."]

. Provide the location of the log backups. Click *Next*.
+

== Recover tenant database

. In SAP HANA Studio, select the entry for the system database, and go to *Backup and Recovery* > *Recover Tenant Database*.
+
image:anf-cba-image92.png["Screenshot of the step being completed."]

. Select the tenant to recover and click *Next*.
+
image:anf-cba-image93.png["Screenshot of the step being completed."]

. Specify the recovery type and click Next.
+
image:anf-cba-image94.png["Screenshot of the step being completed."]

. Confirm the backup catalog location and click *Next*.
+
image:anf-cba-image95.png["Screenshot of the step being completed."]

. Confirm that the tenant database is offline. Click OK to continue.
+
image:anf-cba-image96.png["Screenshot of the step being completed."]
+
Because the restore of the data volume has occurred before the recovery of the system database, the tenant backup is immediately available.

. Select the backup highlighted in green and click *Next*.
+
image:anf-cba-image97.png["Screenshot of the step being completed."]

. Confirm the log backup location and click *Next*.
+
image:anf-cba-image98.png["Screenshot of the step being completed."]

. Select other settings as required. Make sure *Use Delta Backups* is not selected. Click *Next*.
+
image:anf-cba-image99.png["Screenshot of the step being completed."]

. Wait until the recovery has finished and the tenant database is started.
+
image:anf-cba-image101.png["Screenshot of the step being completed."]
+
The SAP HANA system is up and running.

[NOTE]
For an SAP HANA MDC system with multiple tenants, you must repeat steps 16 through 25 for each tenant.
