Initial configuration includes the following steps:

. Storage system configuration
. Credentials configuration for plug-in installation
. For a central HANA plug-in host:
.. Host configuration and SAP HANA plug-in deployment
.. SAP HANA hdbsql client software installation and configuration
. Policies configuration

The following sections describe the initial configuration steps.

== Storage system configuration

. Log in to the SnapCenter Server GUI.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image23.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Select Storage Systems.
+
[NOTE]
In the screen, you can select the storage system type, which can be ONTAP SVMs or ONTAP Clusters. If you configure the storage systems on SVM level, you need to have a management LIF configured for each SVM. As an alternative, you can use a SnapCenter management access on cluster level. SVM management is used in the following example.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image24.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Click New to add a storage system and provide the required host name and credentials.
+
[NOTE]
The SVM user is not required to be the vsadmin user, as shown in the screenshot. Typically, a user is configured on the SVM and assigned the required permissions to execute backup and restore operations. Details on required privileges can be found in the http://docs.netapp.com/ocsc-43/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.netapp.doc.ocsc-isg%2Fhome.html[SnapCenter Installation Guide^] in the section titled “Minimum ONTAP privileges required”.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image25.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Click More Options to configure the storage platform.
+
Storage platform can be FAS, AFF, ONTAP Select, or Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
+
[NOTE]
For a system used as a SnapVault or SnapMirror target, select the Secondary icon.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image26.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Add additional storage systems as required. In our example, an additional offsite backup storage and a disaster recovery storage has been added.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image27.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

== Credentials configuration

. Go to Settings, select Credentials, and click New.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image28.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Provide the credentials for the user that are used for plug-in installations on Linux systems.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image29.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Provide the credentials for the user that are used for plug-in installations on Windows systems.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image30.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]
+
The following figure shows the configured credentials.

== SAP HANA plug-in installation on a central plug-in host

In the lab setup, the SnapCenter Server is also used as a central HANA plug-in host. The Windows host on which SnapCenter Server runs is added as a host, and the SAP HANA plug-in is installed on the Windows host.

[NOTE]
The SAP HANA plug-in requires Java 64-bit version 1.8. Java needs to be installed on the host before the SAP HANA plug-in is deployed.

. Go to Hosts and click Add.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image32.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Provide the required host information. Click Submit.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image33.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]
+
The following figure shows all the configured hosts after the HANA plug-in is deployed.
+

=== SAP HANA hdbsql client software installation and configuration

The SAP HANA hdbsql client software must be installed on the same host on which the SAP HANA plug-in is installed. The software can be downloaded from the https://support.sap.com/en/index.html[SAP Support Portal^].

The HDBSQL OS user configured during the resource configuration must be able to run the hdbsql executable. The path to the hdbsql executable must be configured in the `hana.properties` file.

* Windows:

....
C:\More C:\Program Files\NetApp\SnapCenter\Snapcenter Plug-in Creator\etc\hana.properties
HANA_HDBSQL_CMD=C:\\Program Files\\sap\\hdbclient\\hdbsql.exe
....

* Linux:

....
cat /opt/NetApp/snapcenter/scc/etc/hana.properties
HANA_HDBSQL_CMD=/usr/sap/hdbclient/hdbsql
....

== Policy configuration

As discussed in the section link:saphana-br-scs-snapcenter-concepts-and-best-practices.html#data-protection-strategy[“Data protection strategy,”] policies are usually configured independently of the resource and can be used by multiple SAP HANA databases.

A typical minimum configuration consists of the following policies:

* Policy for hourly backups without replication: `LocalSnap`
* Policy for daily backups with SnapVault replication: `LocalSnapAndSnapVault`
* Policy for weekly block integrity check using a file-based backup: `BlockIntegrityCheck`

The following sections describe the configuration of these three policies.

=== Policy for hourly Snapshot backups

. Go to Settings > Policies and click New.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image35.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Enter the policy name and description. Click Next.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image36.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Select backup type as Snapshot Based and select Hourly for schedule frequency.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image37.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Configure the retention settings for on-demand backups.
+
image:saphana-br-scs-image38.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

+
image:saphana-br-scs-image39.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Configure the replication options. In this case, no SnapVault or SnapMirror update is selected.
+

. Select Update SnapVault after creating a local Snapshot copy.
+
[NOTE]
The secondary policy label must be the same as the SnapMirror label in the data protection configuration on the storage layer. See the section link:saphana-br-scs-snapcenter-resource-specific-configuration-for-sap-hana-database-backups.html#configuration-of-data-protection-to-off-site-backup-storage[“Configuration of data protection to off-site backup storage.”]
+
