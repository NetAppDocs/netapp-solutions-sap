This document describes the SnapCenter integration specifics for IBM DB2 Database used in an SAP environment.

== Introduction

The document is not intended to be a step-by-step description of how to setup the complete environment but will cover concepts and relevant details related to:

* Example configuration overview
* Sample Layout
* Protect DB2 database
* Restore and Recover DB2 database

Author: Michael Schlosser, NetApp

== Example configuration overview

Example Implementation for SnapCenter DB2 Plugin for an SAP System running on the Azure Platform.

NOTE: This implementation describes the minimal required volume configuration. 

Alternatively, the volume structure described in this link:https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/sapapplications/db2-installation-guide-on-anf/3709437[MS Technical Community blog] could be used.

== Demo Environment

=== Software versions

[width=100%,cols="50%, 50%", frame=none, grid=rows, options="header"]
|===
| *Software* | *Version*
| Linux OS | SLES for SAP 15 SP5
| SAP | SAP NetWeaver 7.5
| DB2 | 10.5.0.7
| SnapCenter | 6.1
|===

=== DB2 Volume Design

Following least volume Layout must be used to enable backup / recovery and clone use-cases for the DB2 database. The example configuration use <SID>: D01.

[width=100%,cols="20%, 20%, 30%, 30%", frame=none, grid=rows, options="header"]
|===
| *Volume Name* | *Directory (qtree) on Volume* | *Mount Point on Server* | *Comment*
| <SID>-sapdb2| db2 | /db2 | 
| | | /db2/<SID> | Parent directory for DB2 related files
| | | /db2/db2<sid> | Home directory of user db2<sid> and DB2 Software
| | | /db2/<SID>/db2dump | DB2 diagnostic log and dump files
| | | /db2/<SID>/backup | Backup dlocation (might be placed on a different volume)
| | | /db2/<SID>/log_arch | Offline Redo Logs (might be placed on a different volume – snapshot will be triggered)
| | | /db2/<SID>/log_dir | Online Redo Logs (might be placed on a different volume – snapshot will be triggered)
| | <sid>adm | /home/<sid>adm | Home directory of user <sid>adm
| | sap<sid> | /home/sap<sid> | Home directory of user sap<sid>
| | usrsaptrans | /usr/sap/trans | Transport directory
| | usrsap<SID> | /usr/sap/<SID> | Usr sap
| | sapmnt<SID> | /sapmnt/<SID> | SAP GlobalHost Dir
| <SID>-data | sapdata1 | /db2/<SID>/sapdata1 | DB Data
| | sapdata2 | /db2/<SID>/sapdata2 | DB Data
| | sapdata3 | /db2/<SID>/sapdata3 | DB Data
| | sapdata4 | /db2/<SID>/sapdata4 | DB Data
| | saptmp1 | /db2/<SID>/saptmp1 | DB Temp Files
| | saptmp2 | /db2/<SID>/saptmp2 | DB Temp Files
| | saptmp3 | /db2/<SID>/saptmp3 | DB Temp Files
| | saptmp4 | /db2/<SID>/saptmp4 | DB Temp Files
| | db2<sid> | /db2/<SID>/db2<sid> | Instance Files

Because auto-discovery is enabled by default for the DB2 plug-in, a snapshot is created for volumes that match the following file paths.

=== Steps to Protect Database D01

* Check File distribution, according to the sample Layout
* Check Prerequisites for the Host (vm-d01)
* Check Prerequisites for the Database (D01)
* Deploy / Install SnapCenter Agent on Host (vm-d01)
* Create SnapCenter Instance Resource Configuration

=== Prerequisites on Host

More current information might be available here: 

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/protect-scu/reference_prerequisites_for_adding_hosts_and_installing_snapcenter_plug_ins_package_for_linux.html

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/protect-db2/prerequisites-for-using-snapcenter-plug-in-for-ibm-db2.html

Before you add a host and install the plug-ins package for Linux, you must complete all the requirements.

* If you are using iSCSI, the iSCSI service must be running.
* You can either use the password-based authentication for the root or non-root user or SSH key based authentication.
* SnapCenter Plug-in for Unix File Systems can be installed by a non-root user. However, you should configure the sudo privileges for the non-root user to install and start the plug-in process. After installing the plug-in, the processes will be running as an effective non-root user.
* Create credentials with authentication mode as Linux for the install user.
* You must have installed Java 11 on your Linux host.
* Ensure that you have installed only the certified edition of JAVA 11 on the Linux host
* For information to download JAVA, see: Java Downloads for All Operating Systems
* You should have bash as the default shell for plug-in installation.

=== Prerequisites for the Database – Enable Logging and Backups

NOTE: to enable offline logs a offline full backup of the database is required. Typically it is already enabled for productive systems.

* Create Directories for backup and log_arch (/db2/D01/backup, /sybase/D01/log_arch)
* Enable logarchmeth1 (as OS-user db2d01)
** db2 update db cfg for D01 using logarchmeth1 DISK:/db2/D01/log_arch/ 
* Create offline backup (as OS-user db2d01)
** db2stop force
** db2start admin mode restricted access
** db2 backup db D01 to /db2/D01/backup
** db2 activate db D01

=== Deploy SnapCenter Agent to Host vm-d01

Further information could be found in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/snapcenter/protect-scu/task_add_hosts_and_install_the_snapcenter_plug_ins_package_for_linux.html[SnapCenter documentation].

Select IBM DB2 and Unix File Systems Plugins.

NOTE: After the installation a discovery of the Databases on the host is triggered.

=== Create Resource Configuration for Database D01

Select discovered Resource D01

image:sc-ibm-db2-image05.png[Screen shot of database discovery on the host]

Configure Snapshot Name

image:sc-ibm-db2-image06.png[Screen shot of configure snapshot name dialog]

No specific application settings required, configure policy and notification settings as required.

image:sc-ibm-db2-image07.png[Screen shot of configure policy and notification settings]

And finish the configuration.

==== Sequence to Recover System D01

. Stop SAP System D01 (including database)
. Restore SnapCenter Backup (Volume D01-data)
.. Unmount Filesystems	
.. Restore Volume
.. Mount Filesystems
.. Init database as mirror db
. Recover Database D01 (using db2 rollforward)
. Start SAP System D01

=== Recover Database D01

* Stop SAP System + DB D01 on host vm-d01
** User d01adm: stopsap
* Restore Backup
** SnapCenter GUI: Select required Backup for Restore
+

** For ANF Deployment – only Complete Resource is available
+
image:sc-ibm-db2-image09.png[Screen shot of SnapCenter GUI to select backup for restore]

Summary would be displayed and with Finish the actual restore is started.

image:sc-ibm-db2-image10.png[Screen shot of summary for backup for restore]

NOTE: “db2inidb D01 as mirror” is done as part of SnapCenter Restore Workflow.

* Check recover status Database D01 (as user db2d01)
** db2 rollforward db D01 query status
* Recover database as needed – here an losless recovery is initated (as user db2d01)
** db2 rollforward db D01 to end of logs
* Stop database recovery and online database D01 (as user db2d01)
** db2 rollforward db D01 stop
* Start SAP System (as user d01adm)
** startsap
