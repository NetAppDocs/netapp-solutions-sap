SAP recommends combining storage-based snapshot backups with a weekly file-based backup to execute a block integrity check. SnapCenter Service supports the execution of a block integrity check by using a policy in which file-based backup is selected as the backup type.

File-based backups are also used to have secondary backup copies in addition to the snapshot backups on the HANA data volume. You can use these file-based backups for restore and recovery operations in case of a complete loss of the primary data volume.

When scheduling backups using this policy, SnapCenter Service creates a standard SAP HANA file backup for the system and all tenant databases.

SnapCenter Service does not display the file-based backups in the same manner as snapshot- based backups. Instead, only the last file-based backup is listed.  Success or failure of file-based backups are visible in the Job Monitor view.

The SAP HANA backup catalog shows entries for both the system and the tenant databases. The following figure shows a SnapCenter Service block integrity check in the backup catalog of the system database.

A successful block integrity check creates standard SAP HANA data backup files. SnapCenter Service uses the backup path that has been configured in the HANA database for file-based data backup operations.

=== Restore and recovery using file-based backups

You must do a restore and recovery operation of a file-based backup outside of SnapCenter by using the standard HANA recovery operations with HANA Studio or HANA Cockpit.
