When resources are configured manually in SnapCenter and are not auto discovered, SnapCenter is not aware of VMware and SnapMirror active sync. Therefore, they are not supported natively by SnapCenter.

For non-data volumes like HANA shared, backup and restore operations could still be done using SnapCenter when considering additional manual steps.

== Failure of the storage system configured in SnapCenter

If a failure of the storage system configured in SnapCenter occurs, SnapCenter will not automatically switch to the other storage system. The non-data volume resource must be adapted manually so that the mirrored copy of the volume is used for backup and restore operations.

== Backup operations

Even though SnapCenter is not aware of the SnapMirror active sync configuration for the HANA shared volume, Snapshot are replicated to both sites.

== Restore operation

In case of a restore, SnapCenter would just execute a volume restore w/o any VMware specific steps. Normally you would need to unmount the HANA shared volume at the Linux host, disconnect the datastore then do the volume restore, connect the datastore again and then mount the file system at the Linux host. As a manual operation you could stop the HANA VM, restore the HANA shared volume with SnapCenter and then restart the VM again.
