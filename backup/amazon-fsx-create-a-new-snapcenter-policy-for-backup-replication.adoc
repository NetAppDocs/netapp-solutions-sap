You must configure a policy for the backup replication as follows:

. Provide a name for the policy.

. Select the retention for the Snapshot backups.

+
This is the retention for the daily Snapshot backups taken at the primary storage. The retention for secondary backups at the SnapVault target has already been configured previously using the add rule command at the ONTAP level. See “Configure replication relationships on FSx for ONTAP file systems” (xref).

. Select the Update SnapVault field and provide a custom label.

This label must match the SnapMirror label provided in the `add rule` command at ONTAP level.
