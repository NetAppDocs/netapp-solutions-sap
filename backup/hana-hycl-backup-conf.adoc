== Create working environment for BlueXP

Add the on-premise storage system to you work environment

[arabic]
. At the left menu choose Storage -> Canvas -> My Working Environment
. Press + Add Working Environment +

== Create a relationship between the on-premises storage system and an object storage bucket

The relationship between the on-premises storage and the S3 bucket is done by creating a backup for an volume or by activating a backup of an application. If an existing site-to-site VPN shall be used for transferring the data from on-premises to S3, a volume backup needs to be used for creating the relationship between the on-premise storage and S3 bucket as VPC endpoints need to be used. +
At creation of this documentation the application backup workflow does offer to choose VPC endpoints to access S3 buckets. +
Refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html[Gateway endpoints for Amazon S3 - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud] how to setup VPC endpoints for S3 within your VPC.

To create a first volume backup, perform the following steps:

[arabic]
. Navigate via Protection to Backup and recovery and choose Volumes +

. Press the Activate Backup button +
image:hana-hycl-back-image8.jpeg[hana-hycl-back-image8,width=624,height=309]

. Choose the desired on-premises storage system +
image:hana-hycl-back-image9.jpeg[hana-hycl-back-image9,width=624,height=304]

. Choose Backup +
image:hana-hycl-back-image10.jpeg[hana-hycl-back-image10,width=624,height=307]

. Choose a volume which is stored at the same SVM as your SAP HANA data files and press next. In this example the volume for /hana/shared has been chosen. +
image:hana-hycl-back-image12.jpeg[hana-hycl-back-image12,width=624,height=305]

. Continue, if an existing policy exists +
image:hana-hycl-back-image11.jpeg[hana-hycl-back-image11,width=624,height=304]

. Check the Backup Option and choose your desired Backup Provider. In this example AWS. +
Keep the option checked for already existing polices. +
Uncheck options you do not want to use. +
image:hana-hycl-back-image13.jpeg[Ein Bild, das Text, Software, Computersymbol, Webseite enthält. Automatisch generierte Beschreibung,width=624,height=306]

. Create a new bucket or choose an existing one. Provide your AWS account settings, the regio, your access key, and the secret key. Press next. +
image:hana-hycl-back-image14.jpeg[hana-hycl-back-image14,width=624,height=306]

. Choose the correct IPspace of your on-premises storage system, select Privat Endpoint Configuration and choose the VPC endpoint for the S3. Press Next. +
image:hana-hycl-back-image15.jpeg[hana-hycl-back-image15,width=624,height=304]

. Review your configuration and press Activate Backup +
image:hana-hycl-back-image16.jpeg[hana-hycl-back-image16,width=624,height=304]

. The backup has been successfully initiated +
image:hana-hycl-back-image17.jpeg[hana-hycl-back-image17,width=624,height=304]


== Configure the SAP HANA system resource at SnapCenter 

[arabic]
. Check, if the SVM (hana in this example) where your SAP HANA system is stored has been added via the cluster. If only the SVM has been added, add the cluster. +
image:hana-hycl-back-image18.png[Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated,width=604,height=156]

. Define a schedule policy with either daily, weekly, or monthly schedule type +
image:hana-hycl-back-image19.png[Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated,width=604,height=140]
image:hana-hycl-back-image20.jpeg[hana-hycl-back-image20,width=167,height=167] 

. Add the new policy to your SAP HANA system and assign a daily schedule +
image:hana-hycl-back-image21.png[Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated,width=604,height=215]

. Once configured new backups with this policy will be available after the policy has been executed according to the schedule defined.

In some environments it might the necessary to remove any existing schedule settings of the snapmirror source. To do so execute the following command at the source ONTAP system: _snapmirror modify -destination-path <hana-cloud-svm>:<SID_data_mnt00001>_copy -schedule ""_
