In CBA, global non-data volumes are volumes that are not assigned to a specific HANA system. Examples included the SAP transport directory `/usr/sap/trans` or a software repository.

== Configuration

To configure the data protection for a non-data volume, complete the following steps.

. Click *Add HANA System* and select *Global Non-Data Volumes* as the *System Type*.

. Provide a name and an SID or list of SIDs for informational purpose. You also need to select a plug-in host. This can be any plug-in host in your environment.

. Click *Add Storage* to configure the storage footprint of the global non-data volume.

. Enter the information for the global non-data volume(s).

. Global non-data volumes are listed in the same way as a HANA system in the CBA dashboard.

== Assign policy

To activate scheduled backups, the backup policy must be assigned.

. Go to *Assign Policy*.
+

. Click *Assign*.
+

. The policy is now assigned to the non-data volume.

== Create on-demand backup of global-non data volume

To create an on-demand database backup, complete the following steps:

. In the CBA dashboard view, select *On-Demand Backup* in the context menu.
+
image:anf-cba-image74.png["Screenshot of the step being completed."]

. In the *On-Demand Backup* dialog, select either *Policy-based* or *One time*.
+
** With *Policy-based*, the on-demand backup is treated in the same way as scheduled backups regarding the retention and pre- and post-script configuration.
** With *One time*, you can define a specific retention, a specific backup name, and specific pre- and post-scripts.
+
In our example, we selected Policy-based and thus must select the policy and retention in the next step.
+

+
In the *Job Monitoring* view, you can see the different workflow steps, the runtime of the steps, and the total operation runtime. In our example, the backup operation took 41 seconds.

== Review Snapshot backup information in CBA topology view

In the context menu of the CBA dashboard view, select *View Topology* to open the backup overview.

The backup overview shows the list of backups created by using CBA.

[NOTE]
The name of the backup uses the format that was defined in the backup policy. The same naming convention is also used for the Snapshot name on the ANF volume.

== Review Snapshot backup information in Azure Portal

The same name that was used as backup name in CBA is also used as the Snapshot backup name on the ANF volume. The following figure shows the Azure portal and the Snapshot backups for the global non-data volume `software`.
