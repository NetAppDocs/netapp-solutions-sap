== Supported HANA configurations

SnapCenter supports the following HANA configurations and features:

* SAP HANA single host systems
* SAP HANA multiple host systems
** Requires a central plug-in deployment as described in â€œDeployment options for SAP HANA plug-inâ€.
* SAP HANA MDC systems
** with a single or with multiple tenants
* SAP HANA systems with multiple partitions
* SAP HANA System Replication
* SAP HANA encryption (data, log, backup)

== Supported platform and infrastructure configurations

SnapCenter supports the following combinations of host platforms, file systems and storage platforms.

[width="100%",cols="24%,47%,29%",options="header",]
|===
|Host platform |SAP HANA storage connection and file system |Storage platform
|VMware |In-guest NFS mounts |ONTAP AFF
|VMware |FC datastore with VMFS +
VM with XFS w/ or w/o Linux LVM |ONTAP AFF or ASA
|KVM |In-guest NFS mounts |ONTAP AFF
|Bare metal server |NFS mounts |ONTAP AFF
|Bare metal server |FC SAN +
and XFS w/ or w/o Linux LVM |ONTAP AFF or ASA (*)
|Azure VM |NFS mounts |Azure NetApp Files
|AWS EC2 |NFS mounts |FSx for ONTAP
|===

(*): ASA support available starting with SnapCenter 6.2 release

NOTE: The HANA and Linux plug-ins are only available for the Intel CPU platform. For Linux on IBM Power a central HANA plug-in deployment needs to be setup as described in chapter link:hana-sc-generic-concepts.html#deployment-options-for-snapcenter-plug-in-for-sap-hana["Deployment options for SAP HANA plug-in"].

== Supported features and operations

=== Abbreviation explanation

* VBSR: Volume based SnapRestore +
A volume based SnapRestore reverts the volume back to the state of the Snapshot.
* SFSR: Single file SnapRestore +
A single file SnapRestore can be used to restore specific file(s) or LUN(s) within a volume.
