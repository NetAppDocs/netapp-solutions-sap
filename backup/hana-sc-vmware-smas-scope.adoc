This document provides best practices for data protection with SnapCenter in a VMware environment combined with SnapMirror active sync as a high availability solution for the HANA storage resources.

Author: Nils Bauer, NetApp 

== Scope of this document

The document is not intended to be a step-by-step description of how to setup the complete environment but will cover concepts and relevant details related to:

* Setup of SAP HANA systems with VMware VMFS
* SnapMirror active sync configuration for SAP HANA
* SnapCenter configuration for HANA on VMware with VMFS
* SnapCenter configuration for SnapMirror active sync
* SnapCenter operations with HANA on VMware and SnapMirror active sync

We will focus on a VMware Metro Storage Cluster (vMSC) configuration using a uniform access setup of SnapMirror active sync as shown in the figure below, but we will also briefly touch bare metal as well as non-uniform access configurations.
