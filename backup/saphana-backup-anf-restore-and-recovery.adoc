The following section describes the restore and recovery workflows for a HANA MDC single-host, single tenant system. The differences for a multiple host system are described.

The examples show SAP HANA Studio as a tool to execute manual recovery. You can also use SAP HANA Cockpit or HANA SQL statements for the recovery operations.

To restore and recover an SAP HANA MDC single-tenant system using SAP HANA Studio and SnapCenter Service, complete the following steps:

. Prepare the restore and recovery process with SAP HANA Studio:
.. Select Recover System Database and confirm the shutdown of the SAP HANA system.
.. Select the recovery type and the log backup location.
+
The list of data backups displays.

.. Select the relevant backup to see the external backup ID.
. Unmount the HANA data volumes.
. Perform the restore process with SnapCenter Service:
.. In the Backup view, select the backup that matches the external backup ID or comment field from SAP HANA Studio.
.. To start the restore operation, select Restore in the context menu.
. Mount the HANA data volumes.
. Run the recovery process for the system database with SAP HANA Studio:
.. Click Refresh from the backup list and select the available backup for recovery (indicated with a green icon).
.. Start the recovery operation.
+
After the recovery operation is finished, the system database is started.

. Run the recovery process for the tenant database with SAP HANA Studio:
.. Select Recover Tenant Database and select the tenant to be recovered.
.. Select the recovery type and the log backup location.
+
A list of data backups displays. Because the data volume has already been restored, the tenant backup indicates as available (in green).

.. Select the backup and start the recovery process. After the recovery process is finished, the tenant database is started automatically.

The following steps describe the restore and recovery operations of HANA system PR1:

. To start the recovery of the system database, in SAP HANA Studio, go to Backup and Recovery Recover System Database option.

. A list of available backups is displayed based on the content of the HANA backup catalog. Choose the required backup and note the external backup ID, for example, as shown in the following screenshot, the most recent backup.
+

. Unmount all data volumes.
+
....
umount /hana/data/PR1/mnt00001
....
+
[NOTE]
For an SAP HANA multiple host system, you must unmount all the data volumes on each host.

. From the SnapCenter Service UI, select View Backups in the context menu of the SAP HANA Systems view.
. To start the restore operation, in the Backup view, select the most recent backup, which also shows in HANA Studio, and select Restore in the context menu.
+

. To confirm the restore operation, click Yes, Restore.
+

+
The SnapCenter Service job log shows the progress of the restore operation.
+

. Wait until the restore process completes.  On each database host, mount all the data volumes. In the following example, you must remount only one volume on the database host:
+
....
mount /hana/data/SP1/mnt00001
....

. To update the list of available backups, go to SAP HANA Studio and click Refresh. The backup that was restored with SnapCenter Service is shown with a green icon in the list of backups. Select the backup and click Next.
+

. Confirm that the tenant database is offline. Click OK to continue.
+

+
Because the restore of the data volume has occurred before the recovery of the system database, the tenant backup is immediately available.

. Select the backup highlighted in green and click Next.
+
