This section describes the configuration steps for a single host SAP HANA MDC single-tenant system PR1. The steps are identical for an MDC system with multiple tenants. The differences for a single-container or a multiple-host system are reflected in the corresponding configuration steps.

== SAP HANA backup user

NetApp recommends configuring a dedicated database user in the HANA database to run the backup operations with SnapCenter Service. During the HANA system configuration in SnapCenter Service, an HANA database user store key is configured for this backup user, and this user store key is used to communicate with the HANA system.

The following figure shows a screenshot of SAP HANA Studio through which you can create the backup user.

[NOTE]
The required privileges changed in the SAP HANA 2.0 SPS5 release: backup admin, catalog read, database backup admin, and database recovery operator is required. For earlier releases, backup admin and catalog read are sufficient.

For an SAP HANA MDC system, with single or multiple tenants, you must create the user in the system database because all backup commands for the system and the tenant databases are executed by using the system database.

== SAP HANA system configuration in SnapCenter Service

To configure the SAP HANA system PR1 in SnapCenter Service, follow these steps:

. Go to SAP HANA Systems and click Add.
. In the System Details screen, select the system type, HANA Single Container, or Multitenant Database Container. Provide the SID of the HANA system and enter any text of your choosing as a system name.
. To add a HANA database user store key, Click Add Keys.
+

. Enter the information for configuring the user store key for the HANA database. You can provide any name as the key name.
+
The system details include the IP address and the port to communicate with the system database using the hdbsql client. In an SAP HANA MDC single-tenant setup, port `3<instanceNo>13` is the standard port for SQL access to the system database. For an SAP HANA single-container setup, port `3<instanceNo>15` is the standard port for SQL access to the index server and must be used in the configuration. For an SAP HANA multiple-host setup, you must configure user store keys for all hosts. SnapCenter Service tries to connect to the database by using each of the provided keys and can therefore operate independently of a failover of an SAP HANA service to a different host.
+
You must provide the username and password for the database user in the system database that was previously configured. SnapCenter automatically creates a user store key by using this information and uses the key to communicate with the HANA database.

. To continue, click Add.

. To proceed to the storage footprint configuration, click Continue.
+

. Enter the information for the storage volumes of the HANA system.
+
Select the working environment and the NetApp account that is used for the Azure NetApp Files volumes of the HANA system. Select the data volume of your HANA system, for example, `PR1_data_mnt00001`.
+
For an SAP HANA multiple-host system, you must select the data volumes of all HANA hosts belonging to the system.

. Click Continue.

. To continue with the protection configuration, click Proceed.
+

+
The screen displays all the policies that have been configured in SnapCenter Service.
+

. Select the policies that you want to assign. For example,  the policies `SnapshotEvery4h` and `BlockIntegrityCheckEverySunday` that were previously created are selected.
. To assign the policies to the HANA system, click Protect.
