Detailed information on SAP System Refresh operations using SnapCenter can be found at https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions-sap/lifecycle/sc-copy-clone-introduction.html[TR-4667: Automating SAP HANA System Copy and Clone Operations with SnapCenter].

The second HANA system QFS has been provisioned in the same way as described in chapter link:hana-sc-vmfs-asar2-hana-prov.html[“HANA system provisioning and installation”].

=== Prerequisites

The current version of SnapCenter (6.1P1) has some limitations which are planned to get fixed with the SnapCenter 6.2 release.

[arabic]
. It is required to restart the spl process after each “clone create” and “clone delete” workflows using the command “systemctl restart spl” at the target HANA host.
. The HANA VMs used as source and target of the SAP system refresh operation must run on the same ESX host.

=== Workflow summary

Before the first SAP System Refresh operation can be executed, the target HANA system must be installed, and the host must be added to SnapCenter. Then the HANA system must be shut down and the HANA data disk must be unmounted from host.

==== SnapCenter clone create workflow

[arabic]
. Create storage clone
. Configure host mapping for storage clone
. Attach storage clone (datastore) to ESX host
. Add new disk from datastore to target HANA VM
. Mount disk to HANA VM OS
. Recover HANA system using post-script

Runtime: 12 minutes

[NOTE]
Compared to the restore operation, the runtime of the clone operation is independent from the size of the HANA database. The runtime of step 1 – 5 will be similar also for very large databases. Recovery will of course take longer for larger HANA systems.

==== SnapCenter clone delete workflow

[arabic]
. Shutdown HANA system using pre-script
. Unmount disk from HANA VM OS
. Remove disk from HANA VM
. Remove datastore from ESX host
. Delete storge clone

Runtime: 11 minutes

=== SnapCenter clone create workflow

The clone create workflow is started by selecting the desired Snapshot and by clicking on the clone button.

The target host and SID must be provided.

image:sc-hana-asrr2-vmfs-image30.png["Figure demonstrating the content being discussed"]

In our example we are using a post-script to execute the recovery at the target host.

image:sc-hana-asrr2-vmfs-image31.png["Figure demonstrating the content being discussed"]

When the workflow is started SnapCenter creates a cloned storage unit based on the selected Snapshot.

image:sc-hana-asrr2-vmfs-image32.png["Figure demonstrating the content being discussed"]

SnapCenter then attaches the LUN (datastore) to the ESX host, on which the target HANA VM is running.

image:sc-hana-asrr2-vmfs-image33.png["Figure demonstrating the content being discussed"]

The VMDK within the new datastore is then added to the HANA VM.

SnapCenter then configures and mounts the new disk at the HANA Linux system.

The following screenshot shows the job steps executed by SnapCenter.

image:sc-hana-asrr2-vmfs-image35.png["Figure demonstrating the content being discussed"]

As mentioned in the “Pre-requisites” section, the SnapCenter spl service at the HANA host must be restarted using the command “systemctl restart spl” to initiate proper cleanup. This must be done when the job has finished.

When the clone workflow is finished, the auto discovery can be started by clicking on the resource QFS. When the auto discovery process is finished the new storage footprint is listed in the details view of the resource.

=== SnapCenter clone delete workflow

The clone delete workflow is started by selecting the clone at the source HANA resource and by clicking on the delete button.

image:sc-hana-asrr2-vmfs-image37.png["Figure demonstrating the content being discussed"]

In our example we are using a pre-script to shutdown the target HANA database.

As mentioned in the “Pre-requisites” section, the SnapCenter spl service at the HANA host must be restarted using the command “systemctl restart spl” to initiate proper cleanup.
