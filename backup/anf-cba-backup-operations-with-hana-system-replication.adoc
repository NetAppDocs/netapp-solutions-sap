You can perform backup operations with HANA system replication.

== Storage Snapshot backups and HANA System Replication

Backup operations are always performed at the primary SAP HANA host because the required SQL commands for the backup operation cannot be performed at the secondary SAP HANA host.

For SAP HANA backup operations, the primary and secondary SAP HANA hosts are a single entity. They share the same SAP HANA backup catalog, and they use backups for restore and recovery, regardless of whether the backup was created at the primary or secondary SAP HANA host.

The ability to use any backup for restore and to do forward recovery using log backups from both hosts requires a shared log backup location that is accessible from both hosts. NetApp recommends that you use a shared storage volume. However, you should also separate the log backup destination into subdirectories within the shared volume.

Each SAP HANA host has its own storage volume. When you use a storage-based Snapshot to perform a backup, a database-consistent Snapshot copy is created on the primary SAP HANA host’s storage volume.

When a failover to host 2 is performed, host 2 becomes the primary SAP HANA host, backups are now executed at host 2, and Snapshot backups are created at the storage volume of host 2.

The backup created at host 2 can be restored directly at the storage layer. If you must use a backup created at host 1, then the backup must be copied from the host 1 storage volume to the host 2 storage volume. Forward recovery uses the log backups from both hosts.

== Backup operations with CBA- and HSR-enabled HANA systems

As briefly discussed in the prvious section, you must consider a a few thing for backup operations with HSR-enabled HANA systems.

* A backup operation can only be executed at the primary HANA host. Therefore CBA must be aware of which host is currently the primary when executing a backup operation.
** The backup SQL statements must be executed against the current primary host.
** A Snapshot backup should only be taken at the primary host data volume, because the secondary host data volume is not in a consistent state and is therefore useless for a restore and recovery operation.
* Retention management of Snapshot backups must be performed across both hosts. For example, when a failover to the secondary host has been executed, the backups of the former primary host must also be deleted based on the defined retention on all layers, in CBA, on the ANF volume,  and within the HANA backup catalog. Otherwise deleting old log backups based on log backup retention management is blocked due to old data backups.

In CBA, both HANA hosts, the primary and the secondary, are configured just like normal HANA systems as shown in the figure below. The only difference during configuration is a checkbox that is marked to tell CBA that this HANA system is part of a HSR ralationship. CBA reads the HSR status from the hosts and can find out which hosts belong together and which host is primary or secondary. For CBA internally, these two hosts are treated as a single entity, where a backup is only executed against the current primary host and the retention management is performed across both hosts.

[NOTE]
CBA only supports HSR for a two-host configuration.

== Overview of installation and configuration steps

There are some minor differences in the required configuration steps for an HSR-enabled HANA system. In this section, we only highlight the differences compared to the already described standard configuration steps.

. Create a backup user at the HANA system database at the primary HSR host.
. Add the primary host and configure the HANA system in Cloud Backup for Applications.
.. Select *HANA System Replication* during configuration.

.. Add the storage footprint of the primary host.

. The new HANA system is now listed with an HSR icon.

. Add a secondary host and configure the HANA system in Cloud Backup for Applications.
.. Select *HANA System Replication* during configuration.

.. Add the storage footprint of the secondary host.
+

+
Both system are now listed with the HSR icon.
+

. Add backup policies to the primary and secondary HANA system.
+
[NOTE]
You must add the same policies to both systems because retention management is performed across both HANA hosts.

Backups are now executed based on the defined policies. CBA always triggers the Snapshot backup operation at the primary HANA host.
