The SnapCenter configuration can be separated into two main areas:

* *Initial configuration.* Covers generic configurations, independent of an individual SAP HANA database. Configurations such as storage systems, central HANA plug-in hosts, and policies, which are selected when executing the resource-specific configurations.
* *Resource-specific configuration.* Covers SAP HANA system-specific configurations and must be done for each SAP HANA database.

The following figure provides an overview of the configuration components and their dependencies. The green boxes show configuration steps that must be done outside of SnapCenter; the blue boxes show the steps that are done using the SnapCenter GUI.

With the initial configuration, the following components are installed and configured:

* *Storage system.* Credential configuration for all SVMs that are used by the SAP HANA systems: typically, primary,  off-site backup, and disaster recovery storage.

[NOTE]
Storage cluster credentials can the also be configured instead of individual SVM credentials.

* *Credentials.* Configuration of credentials used to deploy the SAP HANA plug-in on the hosts.
* *Hosts (for central HANA plug-in hosts).* Deployment of SAP HANA plug-in. Installation of the SAP HANA hdbclient software on the host. The SAP hdbclient software must be installed manually.
* *Policies.* Configuration of backup type, retention, and replication. Typically, at least one policy for local Snapshot copies, one for SnapVault replication, and one for file-based backup is required.

The resource-specific configuration must be performed for each SAP HANA database and includes the following configurations:

* SAP HANA non-data volume resource configuration:
** Storage systems and volumes
* SAP hdbuserstore key configuration:
** The SAP hdbuserstore key configuration for the specific SAP HANA database must be performed either on the central plug-in host, or on the HANA database host, depending on where the HANA plug-in is deployed.
* Auto discovered SAP HANA database resources:
** Deployment of SAP HANA plug-in on database host
** Provide hdbuserstore key
* Manual SAP HANA database resource configuration:
** SAP HANA database SID, plug-in host, hdbuserstore key, storage systems and volumes
* Resource protection configuration:
** Selection of required policies
** Definition of schedules for each policy
* ONTAP data protection configuration:
** Only required if the backups should be replicated to an off-site backup storage.
** Definition of relationship and retention.
