As discussed before, CBA supports backup operation of non-data volumes. Non-data volumes are volumes which belong to a specific SAP HANA system, such as `/hana/shared` or SAP application server volumes, like `/usr/sap/SID` or `sapmnt/SID`.

== Configuration

. In the CBA dashboard view, select Manage System – Add Non-Data Volume.
+

. Enter the information for the non-data volume(s).
+
Select the working environment and the NetApp Account that is used for the ANF volumes of the HANA system. Select the volume(s). In our example: `PR1_shared`.

== Assign policy

To activate scheduled backups the backup policy must be assigned.

. Go to *Assign policy* > *Non-Data Volume*.
+

. Click *Assign*.

== Create on-demand backup of non-data volume

To create an on-demand database backup, follow these steps:

. In the CBA dashboard view, select On-Demand Backup – Data Volume in the context menu.
+

. In the On-Demand Backup dialog, select either *Policy-based* or *One time*.
+
** With Policy-based, the on-demand backup is treated in the same way as scheduled backups regarding the retention and pre- and post-script configuration.
** With One time, you can define a specific retention, a specific backup name, and specific pre- and post-scripts.
+
In our example, we selected policy-based, and need to select the policy and retention as the next step.

+
Within the Job Monitoring view, you can see the different workflow steps, the runtime of the steps, and the total operation runtime. In our example, the backup operation took 47 seconds.

== Review Snapshot backup information in CBA topology view

In the context menu of the CBA dashboard view, select *View Topology* to open the backup overview.

The backup overview shows the list of backups created by using CBA.

[NOTE]
The name of the backup uses the format that has been defined in the backup policy. The same naming convention is also used for the Snapshot name on the ANF volume.

== Review Snapshot backup information in Azure Portal

The name used as backup name in CBA is also used as the Snapshot backup name on the ANF volume. The following figure shows the Azure portal and the Snapshot backups for the non-data volume `pr1-shared`.
