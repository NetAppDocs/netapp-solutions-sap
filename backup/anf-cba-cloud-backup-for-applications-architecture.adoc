Cloud Backup for Applications is a SaaS solution that provides data protection capabilities for applications running on NetApp cloud storage. Cloud Backup for Applications enabled within NetApp BlueXP offers efficient, application-consistent, policy-based protection of SAP HANA on Azure NetApp Files. Cloud Backup for Applications provides centralized control and oversight, while delegating the ability for users to manage application-specific backup and restore operations.

Cloud Backup for Applications runs as SaaS within NetApp BlueXP and leverages the framework and UI.  The BlueXP working environment framework is used to configure and manage the credentials for Azure NetApp Files.

A BlueXP connector must be deployed within the customer vNet. Communication between the NetApp SaaS components and the customer environment is performed exclusively through the connector. The connector is executing the ANF storage operations by using the ANF management APIs.

The HANA plug-in provides the HANA database specific logic and must be deployed on each HANA host. The HANA plug-in communicates with the HANA database using the HANA hdbsql client and a user store key. All database operations are triggered by the BlueXP connector.
