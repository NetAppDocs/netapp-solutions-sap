The SnapCenter configuration for an SAP HANA environment with multiple HANA systems can be split into two main areas:

* The initial configuration
** Credential, storage and policy configurations. +
These settings or resources are typically consumed by multiple HANA systems.
* The HANA resource-specific configuration
** Host, HANA and resource protection configuration must be done for each HANA system individually.

The figure below illustrates the different configuration components and their dependencies.

All configuration steps are described in detail in the following chapters.

NOTE: The descriptions and screenshots in the document are based on SnapCenter auto discovered HANA systems. Additional or different configuration steps for manual configured resources with a central plug-in host are described in chapter Central plug-in host configuration.
