As discussed in the section link:saphana-backup-anf-snapcenter-service-concepts-and-best-practices.html#data-protection-strategy[“Data protection strategy,”] policies are usually configured independently of the resource and can be used by multiple SAP HANA databases.

A typical minimum configuration consists of the following policies:

* Policy for hourly Snapshot backups.
+
For example, `SnapshotEvery4h`

* Policy for weekly block integrity check using a file-based backup.
+
For example, `BlockIntegrityCheckEverySunday`

The following sections describe the configuration of these two policies.
