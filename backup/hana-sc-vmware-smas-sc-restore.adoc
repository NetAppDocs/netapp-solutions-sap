With virtual resources stored on VMFS/VMDKâ€™s a SnapCenter restore operation is always done by a clone, mount, copy operation.

[arabic]
. SnapCenter creates a volume clone based on the selected Snapshot
. SnapCenter mounts the LUN in the cloned volume as a new datastore to the ESX host
. SnapCenter adds the VMDK within the datastore as a new disk to the HANA VM
. SnapCenter mounts the new disk to the Linux OS
. SnapCenter copies the data from the new disk back to the original location
. When the copy operation is finished all above resource are removed again
. The HANA recovery is done as usual

The overall runtime of the restore operation is therefore dependent on the database size and the throughput of the FC connection between the storage clusters and the ESX hosts.

In addition, when a resource is configured with SnapMirror active sync the SnapCenter restore operation can only be selected at the current primary site.

While the restore and recovery operation is running, you can see a new cloned volume, which has been created at the current primary site.

At the HANA Linux host, you can see a new disk, which got mounted to the host. When the restore operation is done the disk, datastore and volumes will be removed again by SnapCenter.
